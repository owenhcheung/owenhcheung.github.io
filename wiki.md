## What is GEOG 328 (from syllabus)
This course is designed to equip students with the *necessary skills* for managing web GIS projects, utilizing the latest geospatial cloud technologies for building modern web GIS applications, and providing real-world case studies for inspiration.

### Course Objectives
1. Acquire a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles of web systematic architecture, GIS project management, geospatial data client, server, and web-based spatial analyses.

2. Develop the necessary skills to build web-based GIS applications using either open-source or proprietary geospatial web frameworks.

- Demonstrate competence in managing web GIS projects by gaining hands-on experience in web server management (e.g., Apache 2 server, tomcat, etc.), coding with the latest web technologies (e.g., html, css, JavaScript), becoming familiar with web-based geospatial cloud technologies (e.g., MapBox, Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, etc.), and conducting spatial analysis on the web.

- Evaluate the user experience of a real-world web GIS application and reflect on its social implications, such as geo-privacy and geospatial data authenticity.

* Use ChatGPT to assist the design and development of WebGIS applications.
